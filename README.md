## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click **"Sign in with Twitch"**
3. Authorize the application
4. You'll be redirected to your dashboard with a unique session ID (e.g., `/dashboard/abc123`)

### Dashboard Overview

Your dashboard at `/dashboard/[sessionId]` is the control center for all overlays:

#### 🎮 Twitch Chat Integration

1. After signing in with Twitch, your username appears in the dashboard
2. Chat monitoring starts automatically for your channel
3. Navigate to the **Chat Highlight** panel to:
   - See all incoming chat messages in real-time
   - Search messages by username or content
   - Click any message to highlight it in your overlay
   - Messages are styled by role (subscriber, moderator, VIP, etc.)

#### 🎵 Spotify Integration

1. Click **"Connect Spotify"** in the Now Playing panel
2. Authorize the app in Spotify's OAuth flow
3. Now Playing automatically:
   - Updates track info every 5 seconds
   - Shows album art with dynamic color extraction
   - Displays progress bar synced with playback
   - Animates smoothly on track changes

#### ⏱️ Countdown Timers

1. Navigate to the **Countdown** panel
2. Click **"Create Timer"**
3. Set title, description, and target date/time
4. Toggle timers active/inactive
5. Watch confetti animation when timer reaches zero
6. Create unlimited timers per session

#### 🎨 Visual Customization

- **Color Schemes**: Choose from 7 themes (Default, Sunset, Ocean, Forest, Purple Haze, Neon, Monochrome)
- **Weather Effects**: Add rain, snow, or fog with adjustable density
- **Emote Wall**: Configure floating emotes with custom count, speed, and scale
- **Component Positioning**: Drag and adjust x/y coordinates, width, and scale for each component

All changes save automatically and update in real-time across all overlay pages via WebSockets.

### Overlay Pages for OBS

You have two options for adding overlays to OBS:

#### Option 1: Combined Overlay (All Components)

URL: `http://localhost:3000/overlay/[your-session-id]`

Shows all active components on a single page. Toggle visibility per component from the dashboard.

#### Option 2: Individual Overlay Pages (Recommended)

Add each component as a separate browser source for better control:

| Component       | URL                                                        | Purpose                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Chat Highlight  | `http://localhost:3000/overlay/[sessionId]/chat-highlight` | Highlighted chat messages  |
| Now Playing     | `http://localhost:3000/overlay/[sessionId]/now-playing`    | Spotify current track      |
| Countdown Timer | `http://localhost:3000/overlay/[sessionId]/countdown`      | Active countdown timers    |
| Emote Wall      | `http://localhost:3000/overlay/[sessionId]/emote-wall`     | Floating emote particles   |
| Weather         | `http://localhost:3000/overlay/[sessionId]/weather`        | Rain, snow, or fog effects |

**Benefits of individual pages:**

- Layer components in different scenes
- Apply different filters/effects per component in OBS
- Better performance (only load what you need)
- Easier debugging

> 💡 **Tip:** Use the "Copy OBS URL" button in each dashboard panel for quick access.

## OBS Setup

### Adding a Browser Source

1. In OBS, click the **+** button in the Sources panel
2. Select **Browser**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Chat Highlight" or "Now Playing")
4. Configure the browser source:

```
URL: http://localhost:3000/overlay/[your-session-id]/chat-highlight
Width: 1920
Height: 1080
FPS: 60
☑ Shutdown source when not visible (recommended for performance)
☑ Refresh browser when scene becomes active
```

5. Click **OK**
6. Resize and position in your scene as needed

### Recommended Settings Per Component

| Component      | Width | Height | Notes                               |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Chat Highlight | 1920  | 1080   | Position controlled from dashboard  |
| Now Playing    | 1920  | 1080   | Usually bottom-left or bottom-right |
| Countdown      | 1920  | 1080   | Center or top-center                |
| Emote Wall     | 1920  | 1080   | Fullscreen overlay                  |
| Weather        | 1920  | 1080   | Fullscreen overlay, use low density |

### Performance Tips

- Enable "Shutdown source when not visible" for all overlays
- Use individual overlay pages instead of the combined overlay
- Disable components you're not actively using from the dashboard
- Consider lowering FPS to 30 for static components (Now Playing, Chat Highlight)
- Use hardware acceleration in OBS Settings → Advanced

## Customization

### Adding Custom Color Schemes

Edit the color scheme styles in `overlay/[sessionId].tsx`:

```typescript
const colorSchemeStyles: Record<ColorScheme, string> = {
  default: 'from-blue-900/20 to-purple-900/20',
  gaming: 'from-red-900/20 to-orange-900/20',
  // Add your custom scheme
  myScheme: 'from-color1-900/20 to-color2-900/20',
};
```

### Adjusting Chat Message Duration

Edit `ChatMessage.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change the timeout value (in milliseconds)
const timer = setTimeout(() => {
  setIsLeaving(true);
  setTimeout(onComplete, 500);
}, 8000); // Currently 8 seconds
```

### Adding More Weather Effects

Edit `WeatherEffect.tsx` and add new drawing functions for custom effects.

## Database Management

The project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Useful commands:

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:studio

# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npm run db:reset

# Push schema changes without migrations
npm run db:push
```

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All environment variables are set in your hosting platform
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to your production domain
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is generated securely (`openssl rand -base64 32`)
- [ ] Twitch OAuth redirect URIs include your production domain
- [ ] Spotify redirect URI is updated to production callback URL
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Database migrations are run (`npx prisma migrate deploy`)
- [ ] Build succeeds locally (`npm run build`)

### Hosting Platforms

This app works with any platform that supports:

- Node.js server-side rendering
- WebSocket connections (Socket.io)
- PostgreSQL database

**Recommended platforms:**

- **Vercel** - Easiest deployment, add WebSocket support via Pusher or Ably
- **Railway** - Built-in PostgreSQL, WebSocket support
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Full control, WebSocket support
- **AWS/GCP/Azure** - Scalable, requires more configuration

### Environment Variables in Production

Reference `.env.example` for all required variables. Use your hosting platform's environment variable settings:

```bash
# Vercel: Project Settings → Environment Variables
# Railway: Project → Variables
# Other: Consult platform documentation
```

### Database Migrations

For production deployments:

```bash
# Generate migration files (do this before deploying)
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_migration

# Deploy migrations in production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Security Notes

- Socket.io CORS is restricted to `NEXTAUTH_URL` (no wildcards)
- Environment variables are validated on startup
- Database query logging is disabled in production
- All secrets should be stored as environment variables, never in code

## Performance Tips

1. Reduce canvas resolution for lower-end systems
2. Disable unused layers from the dashboard
3. Use hardware acceleration in OBS settings
4. Consider using a dedicated machine for streaming
5. Keep the dashboard tab visible if using Spotify integration

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Issues

**Overlays not updating in real-time:**

- Ensure the Next.js dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check browser console (F12) for WebSocket connection errors
- Verify you're using the same `sessionId` in both dashboard and overlay URLs
- Try refreshing both the dashboard and overlay pages

**"Failed to connect to socket" error:**

- Check if `/api/socket` endpoint is accessible
- Ensure no firewall is blocking WebSocket connections
- Try restarting the dev server

### OBS Browser Source Issues

**Overlay not visible in OBS:**

- Verify the URL includes your correct session ID
- Check browser source dimensions (should be 1920x1080)
- Right-click the source → Interact → Check browser console for errors
- Try toggling "Refresh browser when scene becomes active"

**Overlay is laggy or stuttering:**

- Enable "Shutdown source when not visible"
- Lower FPS from 60 to 30
- Disable unused components from the dashboard
- Check OBS logs for performance warnings

### Twitch Chat Issues

**Chat messages not appearing:**

- Verify you're signed in with Twitch
- Check that chat monitoring is active (green indicator in dashboard)
- Ensure you're streaming or have chat activity
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting in the Chat Highlight panel

**Chat disconnects randomly:**

- Server restarts will disconnect all chat monitors (this is normal)
- Reconnect from the dashboard after server restarts
- Check Twitch API status if issues persist

### Spotify Issues

**Now Playing not updating:**

- Ensure you're signed into Spotify and actively playing music
- Check that you authorized the app during OAuth flow
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting in the Now Playing panel
- Verify Spotify credentials in `.env.local`
- Check browser console for "401 Unauthorized" errors (token expired)

**Album art not loading:**

- Check if Spotify is providing album art (some tracks don't have it)
- Verify CORS isn't blocking images from `i.scdn.co`
- Try a different track

### Database Issues

**"Missing required environment variables" error:**

- Check that `.env.local` exists and has all required variables
- Compare with `.env.example` to ensure nothing is missing
- Restart the dev server after changing environment variables

**Database connection errors:**

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` matches your docker-compose.yml settings
- Try restarting the database: `docker-compose restart`
- Check database logs: `docker-compose logs db`

**Migration errors:**

- Try resetting: `npm run db:reset` (⚠️ deletes all data)
- Or push schema manually: `npm run db:push`

### General Debugging

**Enable verbose logging:**

```bash
# In development, database queries are logged
# Check terminal output where you ran `npm run dev`
```

**Clear browser cache:**

- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear localStorage: Browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear

**Check for port conflicts:**

```bash
# If port 3000 is already in use
lsof -i :3000  # Mac/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :3000  # Windows
```

## How Sessions Work

Each user gets a unique **session ID** when they sign in with Twitch. This session ID:

- Identifies your specific overlay configuration
- Isolates your settings from other users
- Persists in the database (tied to your Twitch account)
- Appears in URLs: `/dashboard/[sessionId]` and `/overlay/[sessionId]/*`

**Key points:**

- One Twitch account can have multiple sessions (create new ones from the dashboard)
- Session IDs are UUIDs (e.g., `abc123-def456-ghi789`)
- All overlays for a session share the same settings via WebSocket rooms
- Deleting a session removes all associated timers and layouts
